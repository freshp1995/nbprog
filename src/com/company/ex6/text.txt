cons:
Yes you can use only one STP Thread. But the hanlding would be much more difficult.
It would not be that easy to decide what MT List should stop working.

pros:
With one STP you would certainly safe some resources. And you would also have less code.

a) My program should not come in a deadlock state.
   If i would forget to set the field "intrusionCleared" to true after the cars
   have solved the intrusion the MonitorThreads would never be started again they would sleep forever.
b) My program is starvation free. But if i would forget to set current and next to 0 (Cars) then nobody would have
   the possibility to use this cars to prevent intrusion.
